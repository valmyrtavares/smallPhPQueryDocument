I couldn't contain myself and had to go a little beyond the minimum you need to make a php site
Keep the first commit as the minimum, now I'm going over a few more commits to improve the application
for DAO, which is a more sophisticated and more organized way of doing the same
Here it is worth emphasizing that at the end of this committee, the rest that do not participate in the DAO continues to work
My main users screen loads all users, but when I have to post a new one I post
no headaches, when I have to delete or edit everything it still works like the last first commit.
Only findAll which is in the DOM model.
